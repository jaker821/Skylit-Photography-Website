# Local Testing Guide - Skylit Photography

## Prerequisites

Before running locally, ensure you have:
- âœ… Node.js installed (v14 or higher)
- âœ… npm installed (comes with Node.js)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages for both frontend and backend.

### 2. Start the Backend Server

In your first terminal window:

```bash
npm run server
```

**What this does:**
- Starts the Express backend server
- Runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- Serves API endpoints
- Handles authentication, bookings, uploads, etc.

**You should see:**
```
Server running on port 5000
```

**Keep this terminal window open** - the server needs to stay running.

### 3. Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a **second terminal window** (keep the first one running!) and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What this does:**
- Starts the Vite development server
- Runs on `http://localhost:5173` (usually)
- Hot-reloads when you make changes
- Serves your React application

**You should see:**
```
  VITE v4.x.x  ready in XXX ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```

### 4. Open in Browser

1. Open your browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite shows)
3. The website should load with the new dark theme!

## Testing the Changes

### Pages to Test:

âœ… **Public Pages:**
- Home (`/`)
- Portfolio (`/portfolio`)
- Pricing (`/pricing`)
- About (`/about`)
- Contact (`/contact`)

âœ… **Authentication:**
- Login (`/login`)
- Register (`/register`)

âœ… **User Dashboard:**
- Login as a regular user
- Check Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Check Profile (`/profile`)

âœ… **Admin Dashboard:**
- Login as admin
- Check Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- Test all tabs (Overview, Invoices, Expenses, Sessions, Portfolio)

### What to Look For:

1. âœ… **Dark theme is applied** everywhere
2. âœ… **Text is readable** (cream on dark backgrounds)
3. âœ… **Headings are gold** colored
4. âœ… **Cards have dark backgrounds** with gold borders
5. âœ… **Forms work** and have proper styling
6. âœ… **Buttons are visible** and clickable
7. âœ… **No theme toggle button** in navbar (removed)
8. âœ… **Responsive design** works on mobile

### Testing on Mobile:

1. In your browser, press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Click the device toolbar icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`)
3. Select a mobile device
4. Test navigation, forms, and responsiveness

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "npm: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Issue: "Port 5000 is already in use"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Windows PowerShell:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Find the PID, then:
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change the port in server/server.js:
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5001;
```

### Issue: "Port 5173 is already in use"
**Solution:** Vite will automatically try the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution:** Check that both servers are running. The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend.

### Issue: Changes not showing up
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Stop and restart the dev server

## Making Changes

### CSS Changes:
1. Edit `src/App.css`
2. Save the file
3. Browser automatically refreshes (hot reload)

### Component Changes:
1. Edit any file in `src/`
2. Save the file
3. Browser automatically refreshes

### Backend Changes:
1. Edit `server/server.js`
2. Save the file
3. **Restart the backend server** (Ctrl+C, then `npm run server` again)

## Stopping the Servers

### Stop Backend:
1. Go to the terminal running the backend
2. Press `Ctrl+C`

### Stop Frontend:
1. Go to the terminal running the frontend
2. Press `Ctrl+C`

## Development Scripts

Available npm scripts (from `package.json`):

```bash
npm run dev          # Start frontend dev server
npm run server       # Start backend server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

## Environment Variables

If you have a `.env` file with configurations:

```env
PORT=5000
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

Make sure it's in the root directory and properly configured.

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified everything works locally:

1. âœ… Test all pages and functionality
2. âœ… Check mobile responsiveness
3. âœ… Verify user flows (login, register, booking, etc.)
4. âœ… Make any final adjustments
5. âœ… Commit changes to git
6. âœ… Deploy to Digital Ocean

## Quick Reference

### Both Servers (Recommended)
```bash
# Terminal 1:
npm run server

# Terminal 2:
npm run dev
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:5173`
