# üîß Photo Upload Fix - AWS SDK Compatibility Issue

## Problem

The error `this.client.config.requestChecksumCalculation is not a function` occurs because:
- We have **AWS SDK v2** (`aws-sdk@^2.1692.0`)
- But had **multer-s3 v3** (`multer-s3@^3.0.1`) installed
- multer-s3 v3 requires AWS SDK v3 (incompatible!)

## Solution

Downgrade `multer-s3` to version 2.x which is compatible with AWS SDK v2.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### `package.json`
- Changed `multer-s3` from `^3.0.1` ‚Üí `^2.10.0`
- Also fixed `bcrypt` from `^6.0.0` ‚Üí `^5.1.1` (bcrypt v6 doesn't exist)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "fix: downgrade multer-s3 to v2 for AWS SDK v2 compatibility"
   git push
   ```

2. **DigitalOcean will automatically:**
   - Detect the `package.json` change
   - Run `npm install` with correct versions
   - Restart the app
   - Photo uploads should work!

### Option 2: Local Testing First

1. **Delete old packages:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Install correct versions:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```

4. **Try uploading a photo** to verify it works

5. **Then push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json
   git commit -m "fix: downgrade multer-s3 to v2 for AWS SDK v2 compatibility"
   git push
   ```

## üìã What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
```
aws-sdk v2  +  multer-s3 v3  =  ‚ùå Incompatible!
Error: this.client.config.requestChecksumCalculation is not a function
```

### After (Fixed):
```
aws-sdk v2  +  multer-s3 v2  =  ‚úÖ Compatible!
Photo uploads work perfectly
```

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

1. **Wait for DigitalOcean deployment to complete** (~2-3 minutes)

2. **Check Runtime Logs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ DigitalOcean Spaces is ENABLED
   ‚úÖ Server running on http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Portfolio**

4. **Create or open a shoot**

5. **Click "Upload Photos"**

6. **Select an image file**

7. **Should see:** "Photos uploaded successfully!"

8. **Verify:**
   - Photo appears in the admin panel grid
   - Photo appears in DigitalOcean Spaces bucket under `portfolio/` folder
   - Photo displays on public portfolio page

---

## üîç Why This Happened

**Timeline:**
1. Initially added `aws-sdk` v2 and `multer-s3` v3
2. Package versions were incompatible but undetected locally
3. First photo upload on live server triggered the error
4. multer-s3 v3 tried to call AWS SDK v3 methods
5. AWS SDK v2 doesn't have those methods ‚Üí crash

**Fix:**
- Use multer-s3 v2 which is designed for AWS SDK v2
- Both packages now speak the same "language"

## üì¶ Package Version Reference

### Correct Versions (After Fix):
| Package | Version | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `aws-sdk` | `^2.1692.0` | AWS SDK v2 for DigitalOcean Spaces |
| `multer-s3` | `^2.10.0` | Compatible with AWS SDK v2 |
| `multer` | `^1.4.5-lts.1` | Standard file upload middleware |
| `bcrypt` | `^5.1.1` | Password hashing |

### Incorrect Versions (Before Fix):
| Package | Version | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `multer-s3` | `^3.0.1` | ‚ùå Requires AWS SDK v3 |
| `bcrypt` | `^6.0.0` | ‚ùå Version doesn't exist |

---

## üéØ Alternative: Upgrade to AWS SDK v3 (Not Recommended Now)

If you wanted to use AWS SDK v3 instead, you would need to:

1. **Install AWS SDK v3 packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage
   npm uninstall aws-sdk
   ```

2. **Keep multer-s3 v3**

3. **Rewrite server.js S3 configuration** (major changes)

**Why not now:**
- AWS SDK v2 works perfectly for our use case
- No need to rewrite working code
- v2 is still supported and widely used
- Easier to maintain with current setup

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] DigitalOcean deployment completes successfully
- [ ] Runtime logs show "‚úÖ DigitalOcean Spaces is ENABLED"
- [ ] Can upload photos via admin panel
- [ ] Alert shows "Photos uploaded successfully!"
- [ ] Photos appear in admin portfolio grid immediately
- [ ] Photos appear in DigitalOcean Spaces bucket
- [ ] Photos display on public portfolio page
- [ ] Photo URLs contain CDN domain

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Check:
1. **All 6 Spaces environment variables are set** in DigitalOcean
2. **App has been restarted** after package.json change
3. **No typos in environment variable names**
4. **API keys are valid** (regenerate if unsure)
5. **Bucket exists** and is correctly named

### Error Reference:
| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `requestChecksumCalculation is not a function` | Version mismatch | ‚úÖ Fixed by this update |
| `Access Denied` | Invalid API keys | Regenerate Spaces keys |
| `Bucket does not exist` | Wrong bucket name | Check SPACES_BUCKET variable |
| `CORS error` | Missing CORS config | Add app domain to Spaces CORS |

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the `package.json` changes
2. **Wait for DigitalOcean** to redeploy (automatic)
3. **Test photo upload** in admin panel
4. **Verify photos appear** in Spaces bucket
5. **Celebrate!** üéâ

The photo upload feature should now work perfectly!
