# ✨ Latest Features Added - Photo Upload & Permissions

## 🎉 What's New (Just Added)

### 1. Upload Progress Bar

## 🔄 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Upload Process
1. User selects photos → Click upload
2. Progress bar appears (0%)
3. Files upload via XMLHttpRequest
4. Progress updates in real-time
5. Server receives files
6. Server compresses with Sharp
7. Server uploads to Spaces (both versions)
8. Progress reaches 100%
9. "Success!" alert appears
10. Shoot refreshes with new photos

### Permission Check
1. User tries to download photo
2. Backend checks: Is user logged in?
3. Backend checks: Is user an admin? → Allow
4. Backend checks: Is email in authorizedEmails? → Allow
5. Backend checks: Does high-res exist? → Allow
6. Backend tracks download (who, what, when)
7. Backend redirects to Spaces CDN URL
8. Browser downloads original file

---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**
   - User must be logged in
   - Session validated server-side

2. **Email Matching**
   - Exact match required (case-sensitive)
   - No partial matches

3. **Per-Shoot Isolation**
   - Permissions don't carry across shoots
   - Must be explicitly granted per shoot

4. **Admin Override**
   - Admins bypass email check
   - Full access always

5. **Download Logging**
   - All downloads tracked
   - Timestamp and email recorded

2. Upload multiple photos at once
3. Watch progress bar fill
4. Note: Compression time adds to total duration

2. Add email to shoot permissions
3. Log in as test user
4. Verify access granted
5. Remove email
6. Verify access revoked

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### XMLHttpRequest vs Fetch
- Fetch doesn't support upload progress natively
- XMLHttpRequest required for progress events
- Trade-off: Older API, but more capable for this use case

### Permission Architecture
- Email-based is simple and effective
- Per-shoot permissions provide fine-grained control
- Admin override is essential
- Download tracking adds accountability

### UX Details Matter
- Progress bars reduce anxiety
- Collapsible panels save space
- Hover effects add interactivity
- Loading states set expectations
- Clear messaging prevents confusion
