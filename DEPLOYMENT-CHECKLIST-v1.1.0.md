# 🚀 Deployment Checklist for Version 1.1.0

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Password Security (Bcrypt Hashing)** 🔐
- ✅ All passwords now encrypted with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- ✅ Default admin credentials: `admin` / `admin123` (hashed)
- ✅ Registration hashes passwords
- ✅ Login uses secure password comparison
- ✅ Password changes are hashed
- ✅ Production-ready security

### 2. **Admin Account Protection** 🛡️
- ✅ Admin cannot delete their own account (prevents lockout)
- ✅ Only regular users can delete their accounts

### 3. **Data Persistence** 💾
- ✅ `server/data/*.json` in `.gitignore` (changes won't be overwritten)
- ✅ Local changes persist across git operations

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Local Testing (Do This First!)

- [ ] **Delete local users.json** (already done!)
- [ ] **Start server locally:**
  ```bash
  npm run server
  ```
- [ ] **Verify in server logs:**
  ```
  ✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
  📁 Data stored in: server/data
  ```
- [ ] **Test login with:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- [ ] **Should work!** ✅
- [ ] **Change password via Profile page**
- [ ] **Log out and log back in with new password**
- [ ] **Verify password change works**

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "v1.1.0 - Password hashing with bcrypt + security improvements"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for DigitalOcean Deployment
- Auto-deployment will trigger
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build
- Check build logs for any errors

### Step 3: **IMPORTANT** - Reset Users Database on Live Server

You **must** delete the old users.json on DigitalOcean because it has plain-text passwords that won't work with the new bcrypt code.

**Option A: Via DigitalOcean Console (Easiest)**
1. Go to [cloud.digitalocean.com/apps](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Click your app → **"Console"** tab
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   rm -f /workspace/server/data/users.json
   ```
4. Go to **Settings** → Click **"Restart"** or **"Force Rebuild & Deploy"**
5. Wait for restart (30 seconds)

**Option B: Let it recreate automatically**
1. The app might crash initially (can't verify old passwords)
2. SSH or use console to delete users.json
3. App will auto-create new one with hashed admin password on next request

### Step 4: Verify on Live Site
- [ ] Go to your live website
- [ ] Try to login with:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- [ ] **Should work!** ✅

### Step 5: Secure Your Admin Account
- [ ] Log in to live site
- [ ] Go to **Profile** page
- [ ] Click **"Change Password"**
- [ ] Set a **strong, unique password** (12+ characters)
- [ ] Save the password securely
- [ ] Log out
- [ ] Log back in with new password to verify

## 🔐 Default Admin Credentials

**After deployment and users.json reset:**
```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Change this password immediately after first login!

---

## 📝 What To Expect

### Before Reset (Old Plain Text):
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "email": "admin",
      "password": "admin123"  ← Plain text (will NOT work with new code)
    }
  ]
}
```

### After Reset (New Hashed):
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "email": "admin",
      "password": "$2b$10$xyz..."  ← Bcrypt hash (secure!)
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Existing Users:
- **Any users registered on the live site will need to re-register**
- This is a **one-time migration** due to security upgrade
- Better to do this now while site is new

### About Admin Password:
- **Your local admin password changes won't affect production**
- **Production has its own users.json** (not in git)
- **After deployment, you'll have fresh `admin/admin123` on live site**
- **Change it immediately** after first login

### About Future Changes:
- ✅ Future password changes will persist (users.json not in git)
- ✅ Redeploying code won't reset passwords
- ✅ Data stays on the server between deployments

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Can't Log In?
1. Check you're using `admin` (not `admin@skylit.com`)
2. Check password is `admin123` (case-sensitive)
3. Delete users.json and restart app
4. Check runtime logs for errors

### Forgot New Password?
1. SSH/Console into server
2. Delete users.json:
   ```bash
   rm -f /workspace/server/data/users.json
   ```
3. Restart app
4. Log in with `admin/admin123`
5. Set new password

### Users Can't Register?
- Should work fine - registration now hashes passwords
- Check runtime logs if issues occur

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ Can log in with admin/admin123 on live site
- ✅ Can change password via Profile
- ✅ Can log out and back in with new password
- ✅ Password shown as hash in users.json (if you check)
- ✅ No authentication errors in logs
