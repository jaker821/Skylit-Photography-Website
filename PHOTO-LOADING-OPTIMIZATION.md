## 📊 Why Photos Load Slowly

Photography images are typically:
- **5-10MB per image** (RAW/uncompressed)
- **4000x6000 pixels** (way more than needed for web)
- **No compression** applied

### What Users Actually Need:
- **~200KB per image** for web display
- **1920x1080 pixels** max (full HD)
- **Progressive JPEG** format

**Result:** Photos can be **25-50x smaller** with proper optimization!

## 🔧 Implementation: Quick Fixes

These don't require changing photos - just improve the loading experience.

### 1. Add Loading Skeleton & Blur Effect

This makes the page feel faster by showing placeholders while images load.
