# 🚀 Quick Database Setup Guide

## 🎯 Problem
Your website loses all data on every deployment because it uses JSON files that get reset.

## ✅ Solution
Set up PostgreSQL database to persist all data between deployments.

---

## Step 1: Create DigitalOcean Database (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Go to DigitalOcean
1. Log into your DigitalOcean account
2. Click **"Databases"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create Database"**

### 1.2 Choose PostgreSQL
1. Select **"PostgreSQL"**
2. Choose **"Basic"** plan ($15/month)
3. Select **same region** as your app
4. Database name: `skylit_photography`
5. Click **"Create Database"**

### 1.3 Get Connection Info
1. Wait for database to be created (2-3 minutes)
2. Click on your database
3. Go to **"Connection Details"** tab
4. Copy the connection string (looks like this):
   ```
   postgresql://doadmin:abc123@db-postgresql-nyc1-12345.ondigitalocean.com:25060/skylit_photography?sslmode=require
   ```

---

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables (2 minutes)

### 2.1 In DigitalOcean App Settings
1. Go to your App → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these new variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://doadmin:your_password@your_host:25060/skylit_photography?sslmode=require
DB_HOST=db-postgresql-nyc1-12345.ondigitalocean.com
DB_PORT=25060
DB_NAME=skylit_photography
DB_USER=doadmin
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
```

**⚠️ Replace the values with your actual connection details!**

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

Add these to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "pg": "^8.11.3",
    "sequelize": "^6.35.2"
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 4: Create Database Connection

I'll create the database connection code for you. This will:
- ✅ Connect to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Create all necessary tables
- ✅ Migrate existing JSON data
- ✅ Update all API endpoints

---

## Step 5: Deploy & Test (5 minutes)

1. **Commit and push** the database changes
2. **Wait for deployment** to complete
3. **Test login** - create admin account
4. **Test photo upload** - upload a test photo
5. **Redeploy** - verify data persists!

## 🎉 What You'll Get

### Before (JSON Files)
```
Deploy → Reset → Lost all users, photos, settings
❌ No persistence
❌ Data loss on every deployment
❌ Can't scale
```

### After (PostgreSQL)
```
Deploy → Database persists → All data saved
✅ User accounts survive deployments
✅ Photos database persists
✅ Settings and configurations saved
✅ Can handle thousands of users
✅ Automatic backups
✅ Professional database management
```

## 💰 Cost
- **Database**: $15/month (DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL)
- **Total**: Your current app cost + $15/month
- **Benefit**: Professional, scalable, reliable data storage
