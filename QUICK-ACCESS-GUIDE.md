## 💡 Pro Tips

### Email Management
- ✅ Use exact email (case-sensitive)
- ✅ User must register with this email
- ✅ Add before or after photo upload (doesn't matter)
- ✅ Can remove and re-add anytime

### Storage Optimization
After clients download their photos:
1. Keep permissions (in case they need to re-download)
2. Delete high-res versions to free space
3. Compressed versions remain for portfolio

### Multiple Clients
For events with many participants:
- Add all emails at once
- Each person only sees their authorized shoots
- No cross-access between clients
