# ✏️ Edit Details Button Enhancement

## Overview

The "Edit Details" buttons throughout the admin dashboard now open the session detail page **directly in edit mode**, making it faster to edit session information.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. SessionDetail.jsx - Edit Mode URL Parameter**

Added support for `?edit=true` URL parameter:
- If URL contains `?edit=true`, the page opens in edit mode automatically
- No need to click the "Edit" button first
- Edit form is immediately visible

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchSession()
  // Check if we should start in edit mode
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
  if (urlParams.get('edit') === 'true') {
    setEditMode(true)
  }
}, [id])
```

### **2. AdminDashboard.jsx - Updated All Edit Buttons**

Updated buttons across all session types:

#### **Quoted Sessions:**
- **"Edit Quote" button** → Opens detail page in edit mode
- URL: `/admin/session/:id?edit=true`
- Emoji: ✏️ Edit Quote

#### **Booked Sessions:**
- **"Edit Details" button** → Opens detail page in edit mode
- URL: `/admin/session/:id?edit=true`
- Emoji: ✏️ Edit Details

#### **Invoiced Sessions:**
- **"View Details" button** → Opens detail page in view mode
- URL: `/admin/session/:id`
- Emoji: 👁️ View Details
- **"View Invoice" button** → (Placeholder for future invoice view)
- Emoji: 📄 View Invoice

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **URL Structure:**
```
View Mode:  /admin/session/123
Edit Mode:  /admin/session/123?edit=true
```

### **Navigation Examples:**
```javascript
// View mode (clicking card)
navigate(`/admin/session/${session.id}`)

// Edit mode (clicking Edit button)
navigate(`/admin/session/${session.id}?edit=true`)
```

### **Preventing Card Click:**
All buttons use `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the card's onClick from firing:
```javascript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  navigate(`/admin/session/${session.id}?edit=true`)
}}
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Faster Editing:** One less click to start editing
2. **Clear Intent:** "Edit Details" explicitly means "edit now"
3. **Consistent UX:** All edit buttons behave the same way
4. **Flexible:** Can still view-only by clicking the card
5. **Professional:** Emojis make buttons more visually distinct
