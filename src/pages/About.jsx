              <p className="lead-text">
                Based in the beautiful city of Raleigh, North Carolina, I'm a professional 
                photographer with a passion for capturing life's most precious moments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Photography has been my life's passion for over a decade. What started as 
                a hobby quickly evolved into a calling. I believe that every moment tells 
                a story, and my mission is to preserve those stories through timeless imagery 
                that you'll treasure for generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                My approach to photography is deeply personal and collaborative. I strive 
                to create a comfortable, fun environment where your authentic self shines 
                through. Whether it's the joy of a wedding day, the warmth of a family 
                gathering, or the confidence in a professional portrait, I'm dedicated to 
                capturing the genuine emotions that make each moment special.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me exploring Raleigh's beautiful 
                parks, trying new coffee shops, and spending time with my own family. These 
                experiences continually inspire my work and remind me why I love what I do.
